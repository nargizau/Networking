#In Step 8, weâ€™ll focus on S3 backup configuration for both your EC2 instances and RDS databases. This step includes setting up automated backup routines for storing data in Amazon S3 and leveraging Amazon S3 Glacier for long-term storage and archival.

#Step 8: S3 Backups and Glacier Archival Configuration
#This step involves:

#Creating an S3 bucket to store backups from both EC2 instances and RDS databases.
#Configuring EC2 backups (either manual or automated) to be stored in the S3 bucket.
#Configuring RDS automated backups and snapshot storage in the S3 bucket.
#Setting up a lifecycle policy to move older backups to S3 Glacier for long-term storage.
#Terraform Code for S3 Backup and Glacier Archival

### S3 BUCKET CREATION ###

# Create S3 bucket for storing EC2 and RDS backups
resource "aws_s3_bucket" "backup_bucket" {
  bucket = "my-ec2-rds-backups"  # Make sure the bucket name is unique

  versioning {
    enabled = true  # Enable versioning for backup tracking
  }

  lifecycle_rule {
    id      = "move-to-glacier"
    enabled = true

    # Define rule to move objects to Glacier after 30 days
    transition {
      days          = 30
      storage_class = "GLACIER"
    }

    # Define rule to permanently delete objects after 365 days
    expiration {

### BACKUPS FOR EC2 ###
